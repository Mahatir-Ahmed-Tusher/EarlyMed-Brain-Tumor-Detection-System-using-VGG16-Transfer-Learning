        ## üî¨ How Our AI Works
        
        At EarlyMed, we believe in the power of AI to assist in early health detection. Our **AI-powered Brain Tumor Diagnosis** tool is designed to analyze MRI scans and provide a **preliminary assessment** of potential tumor types‚Äîall in just a few seconds. Here's how it works and why you can trust it:
        **üîç Step-by-Step Process**
        **1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Your MRI Scan**
        Simply upload a clear MRI scan of the brain. Our system supports standard medical imaging formats for accurate analysis.
        **2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Image Processing**
        Our deep learning model, trained on thousands of MRI images, processes your scan. It examines patterns and features that indicate the presence of a tumor.
        **3Ô∏è‚É£ Classification & Prediction**
        The AI model classifies the image into one of four categories:
        * ‚úîÔ∏è **Glioma**
        * ‚úîÔ∏è **Meningioma**
        * ‚úîÔ∏è **Pituitary Tumor**
        * ‚úîÔ∏è **No Tumor**
        **4Ô∏è‚É£ Instant Results & Next Steps**
        Your result is displayed within seconds, including detailed information about the condition and recommended next steps.
        ## üõ°Ô∏è Why Is It Reliable?
        * ‚úÖ **Trained on Real Medical Data** ‚Äì Our AI model has learned from thousands of MRI scans
        * ‚úÖ **Deep Learning for Precision** ‚Äì We use a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for analysis
        * ‚úÖ **Fast & Accessible** ‚Äì Get quick initial assessments from anywhere
        * ‚úÖ **Continuous Improvement** ‚Äì Regular updates based on new medical data
